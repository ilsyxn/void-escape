## Idea and Motivation:
You are an astronaut who is trapped in a dark maze. Find your way out as fast as possible. 
But be aware, the void is always one step behind you which means once you made a step, you cant go back!
This is our (late) submission to the [Godot Wild Jam #69][1]


## Controls:
You can control the astronaut by using the WASD/Arrow Keys on your keyboard. 
Additionally, there is the option to reset the stage, just in case you find yourself trapped in the void.
- Move Upwards: W/UP
- Move Down: S/DOWN
- Move Left: A/LEFT
- Move Right: D/RIGHT
- Reset Stage: R
- Settings: F1/P/T


## Credits and Source Code:
You will find the source code of the game as well as the links to every third-party-resource we used 
in this repository. For the Credits check the [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) file.
